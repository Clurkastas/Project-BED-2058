What is Life Quality about?
========================================================
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls()) #delete workspace
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, include = T, warning=F, error=F)

### Cleaning and Visualizing
library(maps) #this way we can visualize data on maps (-> world map)
library(tidyverse) #basic cleaning/ organising functions
library(plotrix) #3D pie chart
library(ggpubr) #chart mattia
library(DescTools) # %like% function
library(kableExtra)

#load data
#data was gathered and cleand in "DataCollectionAndCleaning.R"
dat_raw  <- read.csv("dat_raw.csv")
dat_wide <- read.csv("dat_wide.csv")
dat_long <- read.csv("dat_long.csv")

```

```{r pie chart, include = T}
# 3D Exploded Pie Chart
slices <- c(20, 20, 20, 20, 20)
lbls <- c("Health", "Economics", "Safety", "Education", "Environment")
pie3D(slices,labels=lbls,explode=0.1,
   main="Pie Chart of Variables ")
```

Variables (included and excluded)
========================================================
<font size = "4px">
```{r variables yeah}
